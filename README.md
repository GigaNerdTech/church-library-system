# church-library-system
A single-computer library circulation system for small churches.

This is an open source Windows desktop program written in C# in Visual Studio 2019 with an sqlite database for the backend. To use the current executable, just download the contents of the bin directory.

The library system is navigated by a series of tabs, the central one being the Search Library Catalog tab.

There is currently no security built into the application, so the security will need to be controlled via Windows logins.

I don't have an installer currently, so contact me directly for assistance in setting up the database if needed.

I am working on documentation for end users and for running the database imports.
